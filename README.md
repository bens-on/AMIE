# EDIT LOG
- 2/23/24 by Alex Benson (inital code and objectives)
- 2/27/24 by Alex Benson (inital Arduino Uno Case Model uploaded)
- 3/2/24 by Alex Benson (added code for the LCD integration)
- 3/8/24 by Alex Benson (added ARCIE_MAIN_FUNCTIONS_LCD, this is the main code for the LCD display in function form. this can call the soil monitor at certain intervals.

# OBJECTIVES
- COMPLETE: Initial Testing of current code to make sure readings are accurate and that the loop is able to execute with both the temp/humidity AND soil moisture content statements
- DELAYED: Add RGB LED control to simulate daylight cycle. This can be done with BLUE and GREEN lights for a period of 12 hours.
- COMPLETE: Add the ability to display values on the LCD screen, switching from humidity/temp to soil moisture readings every 10 seconds or so.
