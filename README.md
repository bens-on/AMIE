# OBJECTIVES
- Initial Testing of current code to make sure readings are accurate and that the loop is able to execute with both the temp/humidity AND soil moisture content statements
- Add RGB LED control to simulate daylight cycle. This can be done with BLUE and GREEN lights for a period of 12 hours.
- Add the ability to display values on the LCD screen, switching from humidity/temp to soil moisture readings every 10 seconds or so.
